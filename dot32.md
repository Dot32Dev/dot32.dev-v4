## Who am I ✌️ 
I'm Dot32, a 16 year old from Western Australia. I started making games when I was 9, and I never stopped!
This site was built to showcase some of my best games and projects, and additionally to further my knowlage of webdev.

My language of choice for the moment is Lua, using an open source framework called Love2D for graphics and other useful functions. Unlike larger game engines like unity or godot, there is no GUI for making games, and far less is provided to support you. I have written my own custom physics solutions, and I just recently wrote a [primitive 3D engine](https://github.com/Dot32IsCool/3D-in-love2D) utilising some simple shaders and a z-buffer.

## Webdev
Apart from my comfort zone of Love2D, I have some experience in building websites, and this website is an example of that. Built with javascript, this website is a "Single Page Application", which is to say that there is only a single page, and clicking through the site will adjust its content. Try navigating through the navbar now, and notice that the page never reloads. I also built in functionality to edit the URL when changing page and to read the URL for page inference.

This site stores it's content in the [markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), which allows me to very quickly write pages and format them without ever needing to touch HTML (although my markdown implementation *does* support embedding of HTML if I prefer it). Also used is twitter's emoji pack, [Twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/), to give me some platform consitent and pleasant looking emojis.

## Statistics
I just thought this representation of my frequently used languages was interesting ✨

<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Dot32IsCool&layout=compact&langs_count=6">

Nim is a systems programming language which compiles to c++, however it is designed to look similar to python code.
